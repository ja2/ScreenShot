ScreenShot
=============

Screen printing utility.

*Use*

On launch, sits in the notification area and monitors for a defined key combination (default is `Alt-Win-S`) or (optionally) a right click on the application's icon.

To configure the utility, left click on the icon in the notification area.


*Er, Why?*

When working remotely on corporate networks this gets around the problem of taking screenshots and using them on the remote site. This can be a problem where clipboard sharing has been locked down (such as on remote desktop connections), as the screenshots are normally taken and saved into the local clipboard, not the one in the remote session.
