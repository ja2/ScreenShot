=============

Screenshoting utility.

*Use*

On launch, sits in the notification area and monitors for a defined key combination (default is `CTRL-Alt-G`) or (optionally) a right click on the application's icon.

To configure the utility, left click on the icon in the notification area.


*Er, Why?*

When working remotely on corporate networks this gets around the problem of taking screenshots and using them on the remote site. This can be a problem where clipboard sharing has been locked down, as the screenshots are normally taken and saved into the local clipboard, not the one in the remote session.
